**This software is in beta phase and should not be integrated in any production environment. If you tested it and want to give feedback, please open an issue. Thank You!**.
A new Nextcloud app for enhanced organization of notes.
The Next Notes app gives you much more possibilities for your personal organization. With Next Notes you will be able to create notes with a simple markup for enhanced usability, search for your notes by tags or in fulltext. And a future version will give you the opportunity to share your notes with others or let them even edit them completely without the constraint of being logged in.

See [Website](http://janis91.github.io/nextnotes/) for screenshots and more about the usage and examples or use cases.
Try it!
