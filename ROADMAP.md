#Ideas for future improvements:

##Version 1.0:
* Notes should become internally addressable and accessible by their id in the URL.
* Create unit tests and integration tests. Test the javascript.
* Create the API for the controllers
* Document all methods and especially the API. Document installation and usage in README, INFO.xml and CHANGELOG. Update Version number. Credits to the other authors.
* L10N

##Version 2.0:
* Share option should share the tags also -> no user specific call for tags (maybe it is better to create a custom table with shared state and integrate in existing service)
* Shared date could be a sorting criteria
* Share option with edit and with view only option. Also there should be an open page with whole navigation and so on for shared "public" content. The shared "private" (link-only) notes should stay hided here
