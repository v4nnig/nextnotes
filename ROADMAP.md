#Ideas for future improvements:

* Search fulltext. Filter notes with tags.
* Order the Tags (make it sortable - select2 option) - Sorting table has to be provided (custom effort)
* Share option should share the tags also -> no user specific call for tags (maybe it is better to create a custom table with shared state and integrate in existing service)
* Shared date could be a sorting criteria
* Share option with edit and with view only option. Also there should be an open page with whole navigation and so on for shared "public" content. The shared "private" (link-only) notes should stay hided here
