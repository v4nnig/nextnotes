<p>The Next Notes app integrates within the app menu. It gives you the opportunity to organize your personal notes, tag it with necessary catchphrases and search for them.
After you installed the app, you have to enable it in the apps menu. Following this, you can use the Next Notes app by choosing it in the Nextcloud menu.
The usage is pretty simple. Just write down what comes up to your mind into the editor field and don't forget to click on safe in the editor toolbar. That's it. Optionally you could tag your note for better search possibilities later, but you don't have to. It's up to you.</p>

<h3>

<ul>
<li>Fulltext search: Search for notes by just entering your query into the search field.</li>
<li>Tag search: Search for your tags by entering your query enclosed by hashtags. Example: '#search phrase#'</li>
<li>Combine it: Example: 'term #tag# #tag2# term2'</li>
</ul>
